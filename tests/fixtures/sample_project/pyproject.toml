# Non-regression test for https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/pull/492.
# The underlying issue occurred because `tomlkit` can either return a TOML table as `Table` instance or an
# `OutOfOrderProxy` one, if a table is discontinuous and multiple sections of a table are separated by a non-related
# table, but we were too strict in our type check assertions.
# So adding `tool.black` here ensure that we have discontinuous tables, so that we don't re-introduce the issue caused
# by the type check assertion that ended up being reverted.
